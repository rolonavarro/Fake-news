# Fake News Tracker / Detection

## Project Overview
Our topic is to analysis of fake news articles which recently has become a tremendous attention in 
the news media outlets.  We will be comparing websites against lists of labeled fake news 
sources using Machine Learning approach.  For our project, we will also use Natural Language
Processing to detect fake news directly, based on the text content in the news articles from different
sources.


## Our Hypothesis 
We want to develop a machine learning Model / Program which will identify from the news source which is or 
are producing fake news.  We will build a classifier which will detect or make decisions about the 
information that were given in the news articles, we will be using multiple sources.<br />

Hypothesis: The model will be able to predict whether an article contains fake news based on the multiple sources. <br />
Null Hypothesis: The model was not able to predict whether an article contains fake news based on the multiple sources.
